# Food Price Analysis (2013-2023)
## Overview
This repository contains the final database and R code used in my analysis of the price development of food items from 2013 to 2023. The analysis leverages openly available Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS), specifically focusing on the evolution of food prices over a decade.

## Data Source
The data for this project was sourced from the ONS CPI website (https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/consumerpriceindicescpiandretailpricesindexrpiitemindicesandpricequotes), which provides information on various consumer goods' price indices, including food items, over time.

## Repository Contents
Price per 100kcal.csv: The final processed dataset used for the analyses.
Integrating new foods update.doc: A detailed guide on how to prepare and process the CPI data when including new food items.
R sscripts 1 through 4.R: The R scripts containing all the code used for conducting the analyses.

## Analysis Overview
The R script contains the complete code for the analysis performed on the food price data from 2013 to 2023. The analysis includes:

## Data Loading
Descriptive Statistics
Time Series Analysis
Price Trend Visualization

Data preprocessing code is not provided as not all preprocessing was done in R. A step-by-step guide is provided in the repository (Integrating new foods.doc). 

## How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have R installed on your system. You can download and install R from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
Open the R script (Food_Price_Analysis.R) in your preferred R environment (e.g., RStudio).
Run the script to reproduce the analysis or modify it for your own research.
